# Community Science Museum - Noroff Semester Project 1

![image](/screenshot.png)

A website for a fictional Community Science Museum. A school assignment for my Higher Proffesional Degree in [Front End Development](https://www.noroff.no/en/studies/vocational-school/front-end-development) at [Noroff School of technology and digital media](https://www.noroff.no/en/).

## Description

My task was to design a website for a fictional museum. I used it as an excuse to learn and use the Gulp taskrunner. The copy was part of the task.
